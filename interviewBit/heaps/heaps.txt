Binary Heap - 
1. Complete binary tree
2. all nodes follow some min/max property


Min Heap - 
Left sub tree -> is min heap
Right sub tree -> is min heap
Every node -> is smallest out of child nodes
Element with the lowest value has highest priority

Max Heap-
Left sub tree -> is max heap
Right sub tree -> is max heap
Every node -> is maximum out of child nodes
Element with the highest value has highest priority


Example-
OS process scheduling
Movie ticket booking using paytm(paytm first user and general user)


1. For n nodes hight of a Complete Binary tree is log(n)
2. Insertion time complexity is log(n)
